Pretoria East is the most vibrant district in the city of Pretoria, South Africa. It boasts a large student population owing to the fact that there are 3 universities within the district and numerous colleges. It is also home to a majority of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city. Accommodation for students that provides a safe and vibrant environment whilst offering access to public transport is notoriously scarce in the city. This project aims to cluster the neighborhoods in Pretoria East to help students find the ones that best serve their needs. The project will make use of the Foursquare API to obtain data on the various neighborhoods in the district.
